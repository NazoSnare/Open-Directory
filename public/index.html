With Open Directory you can:\r\n\r\n- \uD83D\uDD25 &nbsp;Find the best content on the blockchain\r\n- \uD83E\uDD11 &nbsp;Earn money by submitting quality links\r\n- \uD83D\uDCA1 &nbsp;Create your own directory and earn money when people upvote\r\n- \uD83D\uDEE0 &nbsp;Fork an existing directory with a couple of clicks\r\n\r\nGet started by viewing the directories below and upvoting your favorite content or learn more in the [FAQ](\/#faq)",
        "faq_markdown": "# Open Directory FAQ\r\n\r\n## What is Open Directory?\r\n\r\nOpen Directory is an open source way to make money from organizing links on the blockchain. Anyone can create a directory, and anyone can submit links. When links are upvoted, each submitter is rewarded with a tip.\r\n\r\nEveryone who contributes to content can earn money\u2014including whoever submitted the link, the category creator, and the directory creator.\r\n\r\nEven the original content owner gets tipped when using Bitcoin-native links.\r\n\r\nOpen Directory makes it easy to organize links while earning money!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Why does Open Directory exist?\r\n\r\nOpen Directory is an experiment in building information systems with incentives.\r\n\r\nIt improves the signal to noise ratio by helping surface quality content faster and by incentivizing more of it\u2014by paying for it.\r\n\r\nOpen Directory is also an experiment in decentralized collaboration and microtransaction business models.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Why is Open Directory in beta?\r\n\r\nOpen Directory is new and experimental software. Every effort\'s been made to ensure everything works as expected, but please use caution. If you find any issues, please contact me on Twitter at @synfonaut\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## How does moderation work?\r\n\r\nOpen Directory v1 allows anyone to submit, edit and delete links. This leads to greater collaboration, but also introduces the potential to take advantage of the directory.\r\n\r\nSpam isn\'t as big of a problem because spammers have to pay. To more they pay the more attention they get, which isn\'t an entirely bad deal.\r\n\r\nThe bigger problem is just disagreement or trolling, which may turn into \"undo wars\"\r\n\r\nIn Open Directory nearly any action can be undone. This can be used for efficient wisdom-of-crowds style moderation, but can also be abused.\r\n\r\nThere are a few ways to solve major conflicts:\r\n\r\n- As an admin you can \"detatch\" a controversial category. It\'s like shadow banning, it still exists but it\'s only visible when accessed directly\u2014it isn\'t linked from anywhere\r\n- If you don\'t like this practive, easily fork away and compete with them\r\n\r\nIn the future, better tools are planned, but for now, the open approach to moderation should work for beta.\r\n\r\nOne big unanswered question is should moderation involve economic costs? Should deleting a link with $50 of upvotes cost \\$50? If so, it could just as easily be used against you\u2026 I hope to figure this out and build tools that are open, fair and incentivize creating over destroying. Please ping me if you know anything about this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## How does being an admin work?\r\n\r\nBeing an admin enables you to control two important aspects of a directory:\r\n\r\n- Detach directories to hide them from view\r\n- Notify users of updated version, which lets you continue to update the app\r\n\r\nTo learn more head to the [Open Directory Admin Console](https:\/\/github.com\/synfonaut\/Open-Directory-Admin-Console).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is a tipchain?\r\n\r\nA tipchain is a list of Bitcoin addresses that share the tip when a user upvotes content.\r\n\r\nThe original content owner gets the most (when using Bitcoin native links like b:\/\/ and bit:\/\/), then whoever submitted the link, and then all the people who manage the categories, including whoever manages the entire directory.\r\n\r\nHere\'s an example of splitting a $0.25 tip\r\n\r\n- $0.07 to original content owner **1K7GAVRBADtMQ3xrbUEGjMWM18pDWTYMjM**\r\n- $0.06 to **Peaceful Link** entry submitter 17KyEfU1KAXLEcqfaNtVrYQEw4ok7NMEhA\r\n- $0.05 to **The Peaceful Sub Category!** category creator 1AYD5781h6g2HzaQr7vULpDq1UxPixF1uf\r\n- $0.04 to **Test Directory** category creator 1H4TBZxxRjA9gXxUvWj4gfuGVXi14ukpUm\r\n- $0.03 to **Open Directory** 1LPe8CGxypahVkoBbYyoHMUAHuPb4S2JKL\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## How does forking work?\r\n\r\nLike blockchain forks\u2014directory forks can be friendly or contenous.\r\n\r\nCurrently **soft forks** are supported, which let you fork the application and change the brand, theme, default tipchain, frontpage and more. \r\n\r\nIn the future, **hard forks** will be supported, which let you fork the underlying data.\r\n\r\nForks can pingback and let a directory know they\'ve left\u2014sending a tip. The fork list sorts by tip and becomes a leaderboard for people leaving the directory.\r\n\r\nUsers are able to find new and interesting forks\u2014and the original directory owner gets paid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the Open Directory Protocol?\r\n\r\nThe [Open Directrory Protocol](https:\/\/github.com\/synfonaut\/Open-Directory\/blob\/master\/PROTOCOL.md) is a open protocol based on [Bitcom](https:\/\/bitcom.bitdb.network\/) for creating resources on Bitcoin (SV).\r\n\r\nIt was developed along side the Open Directory app and is in the early stages\u2014feedback welcome!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is dir.sv?\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/dir.sv is a web mirror of the Bitcoin app running on the blockchain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## What technology does Open Directory use?\r\n\r\nOpen Directory relies on a few key pieces of technology:\r\n\r\n- Bitcoin (SV) itself enables decentralized collaboration and microtransactions enable entirely new kinds of business models\r\n- [Money Button](https:\/\/www.moneybutton.com\/) to write to the blockchain with the swipe of a button\r\n- [BitDB](https:\/\/bitdb.network\/) and [Planaria](https:\/\/docs.planaria.network\/) to build an API that lets your application read from the blockchain\r\n- [b:\/\/](https:\/\/b.bitdb.network\/) the Bitcoin Simple Storage Protocol to store any kind of file\r\n- [bit:\/\/](https:\/\/bit.planaria.network\/) a Bitcoin Protocol Protocol to reference protocols in a decentralized way\r\n- [Bottle](https:\/\/bottle.bitdb.network\/) the Bitcoin browser which enables decentralized Open Directory access\r\n- [Bitcom](https:\/\/bitcom.bitdb.network\/#\/) to register the Open Directory protocol\r\n- [datapay](https:\/\/github.com\/unwriter\/datapay) for pushing admin commands\r\n- [React](https:\/\/reactjs.org\/) for building front-end application\r\n- [Milligram](https:\/\/milligram.io\/) for CSS framework\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBSV price is determined with the following APIs\r\n\r\n- [CoinMarketCap](https:\/\/coinmarketcap.com\/)\r\n- [Cryptonator](https:\/\/www.cryptonator.com\/)\r\n- [CoinGecko](https:\/\/www.coingecko.com\/)\r\n- [CORS Anywhere](https:\/\/cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com)\r\n- [CORS.io][https:\/\/cors.io]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Who built Open Directory?\r\n\r\nbuilt by [@synfonaut](https:\/\/twitter.com\/synfonaut) \u270C\uFE0F"
