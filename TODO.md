## Alpha

* split out lib and my JS file organization
- compile step, minify, remove in-browser babel, convert to c:// and export for web & bitcoin output

- Test performance on bitcoinscaling.io
- Check on slow network

    <p>it's early days so no moderation, let's call it a feature instead of a bug for now and see what the market does</p>

 - about
  - bitdb and money button are essential here, thank you!
  - in my past life i built on platforms that constantly changed the rules. i am building on bsv because the rules are set in stone.
  - react i've never used before, but it ended up being an important piece. letting the data be declarative means i can silently cache and update in the background and the app doesn't have to worry about it. doing this imperatively would be rough


## Beta (Friends)
- Upload website (dir.sv)
- Reset protocol id
- Polish content
- publish admin console on npm
- create good examples (collab with bsvdevs, onchain games, onchain art, onchain utilities)

## Pre-launch (Atlantis)
- Test uploading to chain
- Polish polish polish
- first on-chain upload should be a fork from the website
- double check app updates work

## Launch (Everyone)
- prepare tweet storm
- prepare launch images
- make repos public
- launch on Product Hunt
- üî• Launch!

## FEEDBACK
* bitdb bug: event stream is getting messages it shouldn't
* bitdb suggestion: nice to just say "give me OP_RETURN string array" in addition to s1,s2,s3,s4,s5‚Äîuseful for variable length protocols like MAP
* on-chain planaria... end up doing similar "state processing" code to bring "objects" up to date, eventually will need full Planaria, but for lighter apps, planarium.js?
* protocol processor that's a planaria state machine transformer, but embedded in a bitcoin tx, so everything is still onchain (schema)
* enable regex in jq for more advanced filtering
