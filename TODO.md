## FEEDBACK
* bitdb bug: event stream is getting messages it shouldn't
* bitdb suggestion: nice to just say "give me OP_RETURN string array" in addition to s1,s2,s3,s4,s5â€”useful for variable length protocols like MAP
* on-chain planaria... end up doing similar "state processing" code to bring "objects" up to date, eventually will need full Planaria, but for lighter apps, planarium.js?
* protocol processor that's a planaria state machine transformer, but embedded in a bitcoin tx, so everything is still onchain (schema)
* enable regex in jq for more advanced filtering
