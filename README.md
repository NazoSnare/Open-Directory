# Open Directory

> Organize the world's information on Bitcoin (SV)

Open Directory lets you build resources like [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com), [Awesome Lists](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) and [DMOZ](http://dmoz-odp.org) ontop of Bitcoin. With Open Directory you can:

* Create your own resource and earn money when people tip ([upvote](#voting))
* Incentivize quality submissions by sharing a portion of tips back to contributors ([tipchain](#tipchain))
* Organize an existing directory or fork it with 1-click and start your own ([easy exit policy](#forking))

Open Directory is an experiment to organize the world's information on Bitcoin (SV). What are you going to do with it?

## Start using the Open Directory

Open Directory is 100% Bitcoin nativeâ€”which means it can be accessed from the [Bottle](https://bottle.bitdb.network) blockchain browser at [c://lkasjdflkajsdflkajsdflkajsdlfkajsdf](c://).

For convenience, it also runs on the web at [opendirectory.org](https://). To get started you just need a [Money Button](https://www.moneybutton.com) account.

## Start building with the Open Directory

Open Directory is open source in two ways.

1. You can view and modify the app's source code to spin up your own copy

2. The Open Directory Protocol is 100% open to build for your own use or implementation. Read about it below.

## Admin Console

If you are managing your own Open Directory, check out the [Open Directory Admin Console](https://github.com/synfonaut/OpenDirectory-Admin-Console) for a few helpful commands.

## Open Directory Protocol

Check out the [Open Directory Protocol][/protocol.md] to learn more.

## Open Directory v2

* Planaria to reduce load on client
* Planaria to remove entry and satoshi maxDepth restriction on categories and search
* Planaria to crawl Bitcoin Stickers from websites for including C:// and other protocols in tipchain
* Planaria to sort changelog by graph-dependant order (Neon Genesis?)
* Recursive satoshi counts, categories count all sub-categories with no limit
* Moderation tools
* Statistics (money, categories, links, votes)
* Custom currency support
* Pretty in-browser Bitcom links like bit://<OPENDIR_PROTOCOL>/<txid>
* Pretty in-app Bitcom links like bit://<B_MEDIA_PROTOCOL>/<txid> converted to <protocol name>: <txid>
* Make protocol more generic by using Bitcom schema protocol
* Different algorithms for tipchain, specifying default splits
* Comment pages
* Twitter bot
* TonicPOW integration
* Search

* Open Question: Should actions take into account historical economic costs? ex. undoing a $50 entry costs $50

## FUTURE
* AIP to sign data by author
* Categories "pull up" and aggregate their sub-categories
* Attach comments to votes?
