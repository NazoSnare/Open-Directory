# Open Directory

> Organize the world's information on Bitcoin

Open Directory lets you build resources like [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com), [Awesome Lists](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) and [DMOZ](http://dmoz-odp.org) ontop of Bitcoin. With Open Directory you can:

* Create your own resource and earn money when people tip ([upvote](#voting))
* Incentivize quality submissions by sharing a portion of tips back to contributors ([tipchain](#tipchain))
* Organize an existing directory or fork it with 1-click and start your own ([easy exit policy](#forking))

Open Directory is an experiment to organize the world's information on Bitcoin (SV). What are you going to do with it?

## Start using the Open Directory

Open Directory is 100% Bitcoin nativeâ€”which means it can be accessed from the [Bottle](https://bottle.bitdb.network) blockchain browser at [c://lkasjdflkajsdflkajsdflkajsdlfkajsdf](c://).

For convenience, it also runs on the web at [opendirectory.org](https://). To get started you just need a [Money Button](https://www.moneybutton.com) account.

## Start building with the Open Directory

Open Directory is open source in two ways.

1. You can view and modify the app's source code to spin up your own copy

2. The Open Directory Protocol is 100% open to build for your own use or implementation. Read about it below.

## Open Directory Protocol

Check out the [Open Directory Protocol][/protocol.md] to learn more.

## Issues and Experiments

- Should undoing or deleting an action have a high economic cost?

## Plan for v0.2

The plan for the next version of Open Directory introduces two new experiments

1. Add moderation controls described above (likely need identity support in MoneyButton/Bottle)
2. Experiment with economic-based rules for moderation


For the second one, if a link has $100 invested in it, should you be able to delete it for $0.01?

You can easily undelete it for $0.01, but if you made it $100 to delete, you may have just incentivized spam.
