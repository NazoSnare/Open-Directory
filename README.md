# Open Directory

> Organize the world's information on Bitcoin (SV)

Open Directory lets you build resources like [Reddit](https://www.reddit.com), [Awesome Lists](https://github.com/sindresorhus/awesome) and [DMOZ](http://dmoz-odp.org) ontop of Bitcoin. With Open Directory you can:

* Find the best content on the blockchain
* Earn money by submitting quality links
* Create your own directory and earn money when people upvote
* Fork an existing directory with a couple of clicks

Open Directory is an experiment to organize information on Bitcoin (SV). Get started by viewing the web mirror at [https://dir.sv](https://dir.sv).

## Start using the Open Directory

Open Directory is 100% Bitcoin native—which means it can be accessed from the [Bottle](https://bottle.bitdb.network) blockchain browser at [bit://19HxigV4QyBv3tHpQVcUEQyq1pzZVdoAut/73a34a08f6711b56776e1a997c0292e7110eaabb266bd7fbab5db60d4b552b4d](bit://19HxigV4QyBv3tHpQVcUEQyq1pzZVdoAut/73a34a08f6711b56776e1a997c0292e7110eaabb266bd7fbab5db60d4b552b4d)

For convenience, it also runs on the web at [https://dir.sv](https://dir.sv). To get started you just need a [Money Button](https://www.moneybutton.com) account.

## Start building with the Open Directory

Open Directory is open source in two ways.

1. You can view and modify the app's source code to spin up your own copy

2. The Open Directory Protocol is 100% open to build for your own use or implementation. Read about it below.

## Admin Console

If you are managing your own Open Directory, check out the [Open Directory Admin Console](https://github.com/synfonaut/OpenDirectory-Admin-Console) for a few helpful commands.

## Open Directory Protocol

Check out the [Open Directory Protocol](https://github.com/synfonaut/Open-Directory/blob/master/PROTOCOL.md) to learn more.

## Feedback
* bitdb bug: event stream is getting messages it shouldn't
* bitdb suggestion: nice to just say "give me OP_RETURN string array" in addition to s1,s2,s3,s4,s5—useful for variable length protocols like MAP
* enable regex in jq for more advanced filtering
