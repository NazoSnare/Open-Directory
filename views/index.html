Anyone can create a directory, and anyone can submit links. When links get upvoted, submitters get rewarded with a tip.\r\n\r\nEveryone who contributes to content can earn money\u2014including whoever submitted the link, the category creator, and the directory creator.\r\n\r\nEven the original content owner gets tipped when using Bitcoin-native links.\r\n\r\nOpen Directory makes it easy to organize links while earning money!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Why does Open Directory exist?\r\n\r\nOpen Directory is an experiment in building information systems with incentives.\r\n\r\nIt improves the signal to noise ratio by helping surface quality content faster and by incentivizing more of it\u2014by paying for it.\r\n\r\nOpen Directory is also an experiment in decentralized collaboration and microtransaction business models.\r\n\r\n## Why is Open Directory in beta?\r\n\r\nOpen Directory is new and experimental software. I\'ve made every effort to ensure everything works as expected, but please use caution. If you find any issues, please contact me on Twitter at [@synfonaut](https:\/\/twitter.com\/synfonaut).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## How does moderation work?\r\n\r\nOpen Directory v1 allows anyone to submit, edit, and delete links\u2014which leads to greater collaboration but also introduces the potential to take advantage of the directory.\r\n\r\nSpam isn\'t as big of a problem because spammers have to pay. The more they pay the more attention they get, which isn\'t an entirely bad deal.\r\n\r\nThe bigger problem is just disagreement or trolling, which may turn into \"undo wars.\"\r\n\r\nIn Open Directory, nearly any action can be undone, which can be used for efficient wisdom-of-crowds style moderation but can also be abused.\r\n\r\nThere are a few ways to solve major conflicts:\r\n\r\n- As an admin, you can \"detach\" a controversial category. It\'s like shadow banning, it still exists, but it\'s only visible when accessed directly\u2014it\'s not linked from anywhere.\r\n- If you don\'t like this practice, easily fork away and compete.\r\n\r\nThere are plans for better tools, but for now, the open approach to moderation should work during the beta period.\r\n\r\nOne big unanswered question is, should moderation involve economic costs? Should deleting a link with $50 of upvotes cost $50? If so, it could just as quickly turn against you. I hope to figure this out and build tools that are open, fair, and incentivize creating over destroying. Please ping me if you know anything about this.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## How does being an admin work?\r\n\r\nBeing an admin enables you to control two critical aspects of a directory:\r\n\r\n- Detach directories to hide them from view\r\n- Notify users of a new version, which lets you continue to update the app\r\n\r\nTo learn more head to the [Open Directory Admin Console](https:\/\/github.com\/synfonaut\/Open-Directory-Admin-Console).\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is a tip chain?\r\n\r\nA tip chain (or \"tipchain\") is a list of Bitcoin addresses that share the tip when a user upvotes content.\r\n\r\nThe original content owner gets the most (when using Bitcoin-native links like b:\/\/ and bit:\/\/), then whoever submitted the link, and then all the people who manage the categories, including whoever manages the entire directory.\r\n\r\nHere\'s an example of splitting a $0.25 tip\r\n\r\n- $0.07 to original content owner **1K7GAVRBADtMQ3xrbUEGjMWM18pDWTYMjM**\r\n- $0.06 to **Peaceful Link** entry submitter 17KyEfU1KAXLEcqfaNtVrYQEw4ok7NMEhA\r\n- $0.05 to **The Peaceful Sub Category!** category creator 1AYD5781h6g2HzaQr7vULpDq1UxPixF1uf\r\n- $0.04 to **Test Directory** category creator 1H4TBZxxRjA9gXxUvWj4gfuGVXi14ukpUm\r\n- $0.03 to **Open Directory** 1LPe8CGxypahVkoBbYyoHMUAHuPb4S2JKL\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## How does forking work?\r\n\r\nLike blockchain forks\u2014directory forks can be friendly or contenious.\r\n\r\nCurrently, **soft forks** are supported, which let you fork the application and change the brand, theme, default tipchain, frontpage and more. \r\n\r\nIn the future, **hard forks** will be supported, which let you fork the underlying data.\r\n\r\nForks can pingback and let a directory know they\'ve left\u2014sending a tip. The fork list sorts by tip amount and becomes a leaderboard for people leaving the directory.\r\n\r\nUsers can find new and different forks, while the original directory owner gets paid.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is the Open Directory Protocol?\r\n\r\nThe [Open Directory Protocol](https:\/\/github.com\/synfonaut\/Open-Directory\/blob\/master\/PROTOCOL.md) is an open protocol based on [Bitcom](https:\/\/bitcom.bitdb.network\/) for creating resources on Bitcoin (SV).\r\n\r\nIt was developed alongside the Open Directory app and is in the early stages\u2014feedback welcome!\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## What is dir.sv?\r\n\r\nhttps:\/\/dir.sv is a web mirror of the Bitcoin app running on the blockchain.\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Why doesn't the full tip show when I upvote my content?\r\nMoney Button is smart enough to identify you'd be paying yourself so skips that part of the payment. Other addresses in the tipchain that arent yours will be included in the final price. However the entire payment still comes through as a tip and gets credited to the entry or category.\r\n\r\n## What technology does Open Directory use?\r\n\r\nOpen Directory relies on a few critical pieces of technology:\r\n\r\n- Bitcoin (SV) itself enables decentralized collaboration and microtransactions enable entirely new kinds of business models\r\n- [Money Button](https:\/\/www.moneybutton.com\/) to write to the blockchain with the swipe of a button\r\n- [BitDB](https:\/\/bitdb.network\/) and [Planaria](https:\/\/docs.planaria.network\/) to build an API that lets your application read from the blockchain\r\n- [b:\/\/](https:\/\/b.bitdb.network\/) the Bitcoin Simple Storage Protocol to store any file\r\n- [bit:\/\/](https:\/\/bit.planaria.network\/) a Bitcoin Protocol Protocol to reference protocols in a decentralized way\r\n- [Bottle](https:\/\/bottle.bitdb.network\/) the Bitcoin browser which enables decentralized Open Directory access\r\n- [Bitcom](https:\/\/bitcom.bitdb.network\/#\/) to register the Open Directory protocol\r\n- [datapay](https:\/\/github.com\/unwriter\/datapay) for pushing admin commands\r\n- [React](https:\/\/reactjs.org\/) for building front-end application\r\n- [Milligram](https:\/\/milligram.io\/) for CSS framework\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\nBSV price determined with the following APIs\r\n\r\n- [CoinMarketCap](https:\/\/coinmarketcap.com\/)\r\n- [Cryptonator](https:\/\/www.cryptonator.com\/)\r\n- [CoinGecko](https:\/\/www.coingecko.com\/)\r\n- [CORS Anywhere](https:\/\/cors-anywhere.herokuapp.com)\r\n- [CORS.io][https:\/\/cors.io]\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n## Who built Open Directory?\r\n\r\nOpen Directory was created by [@synfonaut](https:\/\/twitter.com\/synfonaut) \u270C\uFE0F"
